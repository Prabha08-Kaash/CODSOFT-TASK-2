 I developed my personal portfolio using HTML and CSS. 
 This project not only allowed me to apply the skills I gained during my internship but also helped me enhance my web development capabilities.
Key highlights of my portfolio include:
*Showcased projects and skills
*Interactive elements for improved user engagement
